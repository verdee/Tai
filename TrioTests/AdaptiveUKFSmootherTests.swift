/// Two golden layers, mirroring the upstream PR's gates:
/// - The **behavior vectors** are the 9 assertions the shipped AndroidAPS Kotlin unit test makes
///   (`UnscentedKalmanFilterPluginTest.kt`), same input vectors and thresholds.
/// - The **numeric fixture** (`Fixtures/ukf_python_reference.json`) was produced by the reference
///   Python `V4UKF` (the implementation the Boost benchmark scores against), recording its
///   `level_offline` — exactly the value the Swift port writes to `.smoothed`. The traces avoid
///   the compression-low regime, so they pin the numeric core (predict/update/sigma points/
///   Cholesky/RTS/adaptive-R/segmentation) with the IOB gate off. At the time this test was
///   written the port matched the fixture bit-exact (worst divergence 0.0); the 1e-6 tolerance
///   only absorbs potential compiler/stdlib floating-point differences across toolchains.
///
/// The compression-gate tests additionally cover Tai's per-reading IOB extension, which the
/// upstream fixtures deliberately do not: the same steep low is damped when IOB at the reading's
/// own time is near zero and followed when insulin on board explains it.
